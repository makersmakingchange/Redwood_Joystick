# Redwood Joystick

<!--- SUMMARY ---> 
The Redwood Joystick is designed for users with gross motor movement and high strength, providing a durable and reliable solution for adaptive gaming and digital access. With its USB connection, it functions seamlessly as a computer mouse or gamepad, offering flexibility to suit your needs. Compatible with our [Oak Compact Joystick toppers](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Oak-Compact-Joystick/tree/main/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/Toppers), it can be customized with options like goalpost or concave designs for personalized comfort. The joystickâ€™s robust construction ensures it withstands heavy use, while its mounting adapters allow secure attachment to 1/4-20 mounting arms and 1-inch RAM mounts, ensuring a stable and accessible setup in any environment.

The device is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics, hardware, and 3D printed parts. The design uses the Ultimarc [Ultrastik analog 360 joystick](https://www.ultimarc.com/arcade-controls/joysticks/ultrastik-360-oval-top-clone/) in a robust 3D printed enclosure.

The overall cost of materials is about $97 CAD. You will need to pay customs fees if you are outside of the USA and the product can take up to 1 week to ship. Consider this in comparison to the other parts that are more readily available.
